# Appwrite and Next.js Demo App (Appwrite Hackathon 2023)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

# How to Contribute

## Running our app locally
- Clone the app
- Cd CalmGcare

Install the dependencies by running the following command:
```
npm install
```
This will install all the required packages specified in the package.json file.

Once the installation is complete, start the local development server with the following command:

```
npm run dev
```
This command will start the Next.js development server and watch for any changes in your code.

By default, the Next.js app will be available at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser. Open a browser window and visit that URL to see your app running locally.
While the development server is running, any changes you make to your code will automatically trigger a rebuild, and the browser will be refreshed to reflect the latest changes.

You can stop the local server at any time by pressing Ctrl + C in the terminal or command prompt.

That's it! You should now be able to run your Next.js app locally and start developing.
